# Boiler Room Coding Challenge



## Server
- complete the sets resolver so it works with both arguments using `filterSets` and `sortSets`
- decide on `sortBy` options for sorting sets based on parameters available for sets
- make `filterSets` filter sets based on
- add unit tests in `filterSets.test.js` and `sortSets.test.js`
- complete the GraphQL schema for the `Set` type

## Client
- create a list view of sets
- create a filter text input
- create a sort by selector with the `sortBy` options you've created
- install and use `moment-js` as a dependency to render dates in a pretty format
- render a YouTube video embed for each set using the `youtubeId` field
- make it look presentable, use [boilerroom.tv](https://boilerroom.tv/) as a reference
- feel free to add 

## Server & Client
- ensure code is formatted properly using `yarn test` in both projects, this will run the tests and also eslint (we're using [standard style](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard))

## Delivery
- this folder is a git repo, commit your changes to it locally before zipping it up and sending to us



TODO
- yarn init client
- webpack client
- index.html for client
