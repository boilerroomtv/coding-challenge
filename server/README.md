# Server

This is an [Apollo GraphQL server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) built on Node 14.8.0. The entire app lives inside the `index.js` file.

Install dependencies with `yarn` (or `npm`).

To run the app run `yarn start`, this will also watch for changes and restart the application when you make them using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).

The server runs at `http://localhost:4000/`
