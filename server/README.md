# Server

This is an [Apollo GraphQL server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) built on Node 14.8.0. The entire app lives inside the `index.js` file.

Install dependencies with `yarn` (or `npm`).

To develop run `yarn dev`, this will watch for changes and restart the application when you make them using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).

To start the server run `yarn start`.
